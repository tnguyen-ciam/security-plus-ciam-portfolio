Practical lab portfolio for CompTIA Security+ and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), applying core security principles to modern IAM workflows. Demonstrates hands-on experience with identity providers (IdPs), compliance frameworks, and cloud-native security tools.


# Security+ and CIAM Hands-On Lab Portfolio

This repository is an active, public work-in-progress documenting my hands-on labs for the CompTIA Security+ certification and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) best practices.  
It demonstrates the application of security principles to modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) workflows, with a focus on real-world identity provider integrations, compliance, and cloud-native security tools.

---

## üéØ Purpose
- Apply Security+ concepts to real-world IAM and CIAM workflows.
- Showcase practical skills in authentication, authorization, MFA, SSO, and identity lifecycle management.
- Build a visible record of continuous learning and skill development.
- Provide recruiters and hiring managers with evidence of hands-on security capability.

## üõ† Lab Structure
Labs are organized by Security+ domain and mapped to CIAM skills:

1. **General Security Concepts**  
   *Lab Example:* IAM roles and least privilege implementation in Auth0.

2. **Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations**  
   *Lab Example:* MFA configuration in Okta with account lockout simulation.

3. **Security Architecture**  
   *Lab Example:* OIDC integration between Auth0 and a containerized app.

4. **Security Operations**  
   *Lab Example:* Azure AD sign-in log analysis for impossible travel alerts.

5. **Security Program Management**  
   *Lab Example:* GDPR-compliant consent screens and privacy policies.
